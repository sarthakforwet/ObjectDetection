# ObjectDetection

Introduction

Object detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos.

Object detection algorithms typically leverage machine learning or deep learning to produce meaningful results. If you had tried Object Detection from scratch, you would know the hassle one has to go through to get a model to train.

Here we made easy object detection by using Monk AI object detection library.
